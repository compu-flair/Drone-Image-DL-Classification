## 1. 🛠️ Project Setup

1. Open **Google Colab** (free, no installation).
2. Create a new notebook and title it:

   ```
   kaggle_project_<competition_name>.ipynb
   ```
3. Set up your notebook with the following sections:

   * **Introduction**
   * **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   * **Model Building & Training**
   * **Evaluation**
   * **Prediction & Submission**
   * **Deployment (optional)**
   * **Conclusion & Next Steps**

👉 Keep Markdown cells descriptive, as if you’re teaching a beginner.

## 2. 📂 Data Collection

1. Use Kaggle API to download datasets:

   ```bash
   !pip install kaggle
   !kaggle competitions download -c <competition-name>
   ```
2. Upload data to Colab (if needed).
3. Store files in `data/` folder structure:

   ```
   data/
     raw/
     processed/
   ```

## 3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Use **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly** for visualizations.
* Checklist:

  * Shape of data, missing values, duplicates.
  * Summary statistics.
  * Correlations, feature distributions.
  * At least 2–3 plots (histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps).

👉 Document **key insights** in Markdown.

## 4. 🤖 Model Building

1. Start simple (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree).
2. Add advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks).
3. Compare results in a table:

   | Model | Metric (Accuracy/F1/etc.) | Notes |
   | ----- | ------------------------- | ----- |

👉 Add comments like:

> *“Bootcamp students learn how to tune hyperparameters systematically with Optuna.”*

### 💡 Suggestions for Improvements

* 📊 Add more visualizations in the EDA section to better understand feature distributions and relationships.
* 🚀 Try CatBoost or LightGBM for potentially better performance.
* 🛠️ Experiment with different feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
* 🤝 Use ensemble methods to combine multiple models for better predictions.
* 🎯 Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

## 5. 📈 Evaluation & Leaderboard Submission

1. Generate predictions using test set.
2. Save predictions in the format required by Kaggle (`submission.csv`).
3. Submit to Kaggle and screenshot your position on the leaderboard.

---

## 6. 🌐 Deployment

1. Use **Streamlit** or **Gradio** in Colab or **Ducker** in our server to create a demo app.
2. Showcase predictions interactively.
3. Save a short Loom video or GIF demo.
